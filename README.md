# Motion Built

This project is to help people learn new skills in the world of photography, as an online community and online course we teach people small or large skills. Then they can put themselves forwards for Photographer of the Month, and win awards anything from a Macbook Pro to 1 years worth of Creative Cloud.

## Features
<hr>

This project has multiple different sections to engage the viewer, to help guide them into if they want to get involved.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

    - Featured on the two pages, created as a fully responsive navigation bar including the Logo and then linking to the Winners page and the other three to sections on the home page

    - The links allow navigation from one section to the other as a hassle free moment and good user interaction.

- __Landing Page Image__

    - The landing page image has an animation to keep the viewers attention.

    - There is an overlay so the Writing stands out and tells the user what website they are on.

- __Skill's to Learn Section__

    - This is the area that is to show just a few skills that the user of this online course will learn, but also the biggest challenges people face when learning Photography.

    - The idea of this section is to connect with the viewer who wants to learn, and they may want to learn these subjects. They may have been at a sports event or where animals are and tried to capture images, but not got a result like they would want to.

- __Rewards Given out Each Month__

    - As a community i want people to get involved into the monthly challenges, bringing people into the community to share their images and be assessed by Professional Photographers with years of experience.

- __Sign Up Section__

    - The sign up area is here as the first step, to get people involved in the process to learn and start the growth of passion. I wanted it to be quick and simple for the first step.

- __Footer Section__

    - The footer section to help people connect directly with us on any platform we are on. This includes social media links and email.

    - This page is responsive on various device sizes.

### Features left to Implement

    - If i had the experience or knowledge, i would of added a rolling gallery on the homepage with a light box effect. This would be when people hover over the image.

## Testing

Throughout the creation process i have been using the HMTL Validator to find issues that i may have missed, this has been quite a quick and easy way to find the faults.

The website shrinks down to fit into the different breakpoints, but this doesn't effect the usability of the website or features.

- __Validator Testing__

    - HTML
        - As i was using the validator throughout the building process and not just at the end, errors where returned, but they were all actioned.

    ![html validation](/assets/images/html-validator.png)

    - CSS
        - No errors were found when passing through the official Validator

    ![css validation](/assets/images/css-validator.png)

    - Lighthouse
        - For testing the SEO, usability and accessibility of this website we used a tool within Dev Tools on Chrome, Lighthouse.

### Unfixed Bugs

The only unfixed bug is an issue with the footer when going below 400px breakpoint and it drops below the viewpoint, i found this at the very last stage and will continue to work on this.
