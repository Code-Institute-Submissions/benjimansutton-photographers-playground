# Motion Built Project One - Code Institute 

## Introduction

>This project is to help people learn new skills in the world of photography, as an online community and online course we teach people small or large skills. Then they can put themselves forwards for Photographer of the Month, and win awards anything from a Macbook Pro to 1years worth of Creative Cloud. In this project i have used the skills learnt in the HTML & CSS sections of the Code Institute Diploma Qualification i am working on.

## Deployment Section

>In this section i show the credits, in where i have used code from other areas. I have used two elements from the Love Running Project. These Include help and guidance making theHero Animation and the Gallery section. Without this project i would have developed more research on the W3S website in the area of animation.

>I also used the W3S website for the creation of the Social Media Blocks in the footer.

>All the media used is from the Pexles Website, this was done as it is not a real gallery, but showing what it would look like when this project is built.
